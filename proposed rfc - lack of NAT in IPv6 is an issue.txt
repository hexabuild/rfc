Abstract
Lack of NAT is slowing IPv6 adoption. These are real world scenarios that Enterprises
must address to successfully adopt IPv6. This document outlines the problems, issues,
and potential solutions. The goal is the help increase the adoption of IPv6 in Enterprise.


1.  Introduction
<Walk through the document>
While we advocate for GUA IPv6 end to end addressing where it is possible. If we want IPv6
Enterprise deployment, we need to provide the tools and architecture options to these organization.

We are taking the position that SOME IPv6 is better than NO IPv6 deployed. We can iterate on the design
and the deployment over time but initial adoption is too important right now.

2.  Defining NAT in Enterprise IPv6 problem space

2.1 Architect and Design drivers for Enterprise:
a. Regulatory issues FIPS, HIPAA, NIST, PCI/DSS, and others
b. Need solution for SD-WAN with multiple PA space (overlay/underlay)
c. Need solution for retail guest/partner/IoT
d. Cloud service providers having reusable space for dual-stack networks to NAT outbound to public IPv6
e. Container and Kubernetes able to leverage reusable space (simply deployment)
f. Lab and development environments

2.2 Operational drivers for Enterprise:
a. Default state is fail closed (need address space that does NOT route to the DFZ)
b. Need solution for SD-WAN with multiple PA space (overlay/underlay)
c. Need address space for underlay solution to isolate for security reasons (avoiding accidental leak or firewall holes)
d. DDOS rapid move address space/services and mapping
e. Cloud service providers having reusable space for dual-stack networks to NAT outbound to public IPv6
f. Lab and development environments
g. Mobile prefix (hot spot) NAT to Route into network - LTE
h. Reduce number of /48 prefixes in the DFZ
i. Reduce failover time between Service Providers with PA prefixes


3.  Operational Implications

3.1 Operational enterprise issues that will drive this requirement:
a. Reduce accidental exposure of routing or planned "non" routable GUA making it into the DFZ
b. Not able to match existing IPv4 operational deployment and design
c. SD-WAN and private routing options (overlay/underlay)
d. Regulator says no GUA space for a service
e. Lack of repeatability for lab and automation scaling
f. Mismatched GUA prefixes from PA providers (why NPTv6 doesn't work for all situations)
g. Scanning and tracking hosts
h. Tracking hosts will continue to be as difficult with IPv4
i. Logging and event cooralation will continue to be an issue
j. Accidents happen - have a safer default behavior then GUA <- this is the goal - fail closed


4.  Possible Solutions

4.1 Current options:
a. Use  PI Global Unicast Addresses everywhere
b. Run BGP with PI space in all remote sites that have multiple providers
c. Sites that have multiple providers but no PI space, use both PA prefixes
d. NPTv6 from PA to PI, assuming all the prefixes match
e. NAT66 from PI to PI or from PA to PI, overloading of IPv6 addresses?
f. SIIT 

4.2 Possible options:
a. Introduce new Prefix that is designated not routable in the DFZ
b. Introduce NAT66 as a standard (requires RFC) - will need to have overloading
c. Introduce fractional NPTv6 (partial or smaller groups of prefixes) /40 and /44 <- optionally split apart /48 or /64
