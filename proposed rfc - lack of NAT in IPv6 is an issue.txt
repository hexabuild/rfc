RFC XXXX         NAT in IPv6      April 2022

2.  Defining NAT in Enterprise IPv6 problem space

Use cases for Enterprise:
a. Regulatory issues PCI/DSS (do some digging and research on this), HIPPA, OMB memo, FIPS, 
b. Default state is fail closed (need address space that does NOT route to the DFZ)
c. Need solution for SD-WAN with multiple PA space (overlay/underlay)
d. Need address space for underlay solution to isolate for security reasons (avoiding accidental leak or firewall holes)
e. Need solution for retail guest/partner/IoT
f. DDOS rapid move address space/services and mapping
g. Cloud service providers having reusable space for dual-stack networks to NAT outbound to public IPv6
h. Container and Kubernetes able to leverage reusable space (simply deployment)
i. Lab and development environments



3.  Operational Implications

Operational enterprise issues that will drive this requirement:
a. Reduce accidental exposure of routing or planned "non" routable GUA making it into the DFZ
b. Not able to match existing IPv4 operational deployment and design
c. SD-WAN and private routing options (overlay/underlay)
d. Regulator says no GUA space for a service
e. Lack of repeatability for lab and automation scaling
f. Mismatched GUA prefixes from PA providers (why NPTv6 doesn't work for all situations)
