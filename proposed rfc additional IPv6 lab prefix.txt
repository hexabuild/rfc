Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   lab examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast address
   prefix is reserved for use in lab and proof of concept validation
   networks and for similar use cases. This document describes the use 
   of the IPv6 address prefix 0200::/7 as a reserved prefix for this
   purpose (repurposing the deprecated OSI NSAP-mapped prefix [RFC4548]).


1.  Introduction

   The address architecture for IPv6 [1] does not specifically allocate
   an IPv6 address prefix for an IPv6 lab. For this lab purpose,
   the address space will function in a use cases where global unicast
   addresses are not needed or desired. This space SHOULD NOT be used
   for addresses which are allocated in other RFC's for specific
   purposes. For example, the current IPv6 documentation prefix of
   2001:db8::/32 and 3ffe::/16 are useable for documentation but
   organizations should avoid those prefixes for a lab environment. 
   Designing labs utilizing ULA fc00::/7 (RFC4193) is problematic
   due to the random global ID requirement preventing hierarchical 
   network prefix design possibilities.
   The use of an IPv6 lab prefix avoids the problem that exists in 
   IPv4 networks of having the mixed use of lab, documentation, private, 
   and globally routable addresses.
   
   In cases where it is not feasible to utilize their existing global
   unicast address space for proof of concept, prototype, or labs this
   lab prefix can be used for this purpose.

RFC XXXY         IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Lab       <Month> 2021

2.  New Lab IPv6 Address Prefix

   The prefix allocated for lab and testing purposes is 0200::/7.

3.  Operational Implications

   This lab prefix is seperate from the prefix used for RFC5180
   that is set aside for performance testing, and MUST not be used for
   RFC5180 validation purpose.
   
   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators should add this
   address prefix to the list of non-routeable IPv6 address space, and
   if packet filters are deployed, then this address prefix should be
   added to packet filters.
   
   Because this address prefix has previously been used for the OSI
   NSAP-mapped prefix set in RFC4048 and RFC4548, and deprecated, 
   this address prefix is already limited in its usability.
   In addition, the address prefix was returned to IANA and is
   available to be marked for lab or other purposes.

   This is not a local-use address prefix, and the filters may be used
   in both local and public contexts.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix  0200::/7 as a lab-only prefix in the IPv6 ddress registry. 
   No end party is to be assigned this address.

5.  Security Considerations
 
   IPv6 addressing labs generally do not have any direct impact on
   Internet infrastructure security.

   However, the assignment of a new address space for lab purposes does
   mean, as indicated above, that these addresses SHOULD
   be added to any filters required by individual operators to prevent
   their use for globally routed destinations.
