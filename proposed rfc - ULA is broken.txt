Abstract

1.  Introduction

Buraglio, et al.               Informational                      [Page 1]

RFC XXXX         ULA is Broken      April 2022

2.  Defining how ULA is Broken

RFC 6724 definition is incorrect for ULA precedence if a host is operating in a dual-stack environment. Expected 
behavior would be that ULA address space would be preferred over IPv4, however this is not the case.

3.  Operational Implications

There are demonstrated uses cases of ULA not being preferred in some OS and network equipment over IPv4.
Need to update RFC 6724
This update will likely take between 10-20 years to become common enough for relatively consistent behavior
within operating systems. * (note that it has taken longer for RFC 3484 - 2003
to move to 6724 - 2012 than 10+ years in total as there are still systems on many networks with 3484 behavior)
Issues with: printers, cameras, fixed devices, IoT sensors, long lifecycle equipment
Means moving to dual-stack with ULA results in inconsistent and difficult to troubleshoot operational issues.
Mean teams are not gaining IPv6 experience as no traffic is actually using IPv6.
Unexpected behavior can result in odd operational outcomes which can result in security and compliance issues.
